My lab is just the singular pa2.cpp that uses the makefile to compile (invoked by the build.sh).
I'm pretty sure the limit of my simulator is 500 cycles (I statically made some vectors that hold information), but I can increase it if need be (let me know at dgilson@utk.edu).
I think there are a few timing issues with my SW/FSW and LW/FLW in terms of proper execution time, but I'm confident most everything else is correct.
My implementation does not give the simulation statistics, but I'm pretty sure Dr. Jantz said that part wasn't being graded on and to really only focus on the simulation cycles.
